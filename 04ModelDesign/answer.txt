1. When would you use a weak entity?
	We would use a weak entity when they can't exist in the database independently of their owning entity.

2. Is it better to use entities instead of attributes?
	No,it is not better.

3. (1)One album can obtain two or more different artists. So, artist and album relationship change many to many.
    (2)One track can sing two or more different artists.So,track and artist add to many-to-many relationship.
	for this exercise,my ER diagram is no3.jpg.

4. (1) Media_store is a strong entity, product_id is the primary key to distinguish between products.This entity contains product_name attribute.

    (2) Video_DVD is a weak entity with video_dvd_id as a weak key.The media store must have many video DVDs.
	So,media_store entity participate in the one-to-many relationship with video_DVD.
	This entity contains video_title, video_price and studio_name attributes.

    (3) Music_CD is a weak entity with CD_id as a weak key.The media store must have many music cds.
	So,media_store entity participate in the one-to-many relationship with music_CD.
  	This entity contains CD_label, CD_title, CD_price and artist_name attributes.

    (4) As a weak entity,track participate in the many-to-one relationship with music_CD.
	Track entity contains track_name,track_title,and track_length attributes.
    
    (5) Customer is a strong entity with customer_id as the primary key.Many customers can buy many videos and music CD.
              So,their relationship is many-to-many.This entity contains customer_email attribute.

I don't add payment type and system for customer entity.You would like to answer if I should add.
